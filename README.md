# 360 Rotate Hack (multiplayer supported)

This cheat was made in a very rushed manner, and I didn’t put much effort into organizing it properly.  
That's why you might see some questionable file names and project structure—sorry about that! ;D  

This plugin introduces an aimbot and automatic rotation functionality, allowing the player character to turn towards the nearest enemy in the game. It leverages the BepInEx library for game integration and Harmony for patching.

## Features

- **Automatic aiming:** Targets the nearest enemy.
- **Movement prediction:** Improves accuracy by predicting enemy movement.
- **Graphical interface:** Displays aimbot status and other useful details.
- **Customizable controls:** Adjust rotation speed and direction.

## Installation

1. **Ensure you have BepInEx version 5.4.20.0 installed.**
   - Download BepInEx from the [official GitHub page](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.20).
   - Extract the archive into your game directory, for example:
     ```
     /GameFolder/BepInEx/
     ```

2. **Run the game once:**
   - Launch the game to allow BepInEx to generate the necessary folders, such as `plugins`.

3. **Install the plugin:**
   - Move the plugin file (e.g., `MyFirstPlugin.dll`) into the following folder:
     ```
     /GameFolder/BepInEx/plugins/
     ```

4. **Start the game:**
   - The plugin will automatically load when you launch the game.

  Press `R` to enable or disable the aimbot.

- **Adjust prediction time:**
  Use the slider at the top of the screen to modify the prediction time (from 0.1 to 3 seconds).

  The screen will show the name of the nearest target and their velocity.
